# Serverless Task Migration

The Serverless task migration app is a tool for analyzing the running tasks on your snowflake account and migrating anything that may not be optimized.
The app looks at two siatuations in particular

- Tasks that run quickly, and spin up a warehouse but do not utilize enough time on it to justify the cost of starting it.
- Tasks that are long running and regularly overshoot their next target start schedule

The goal is to migrate any tasks in either situation to a serverless task, this is due to two of the features in a serverless task. The fact that it is serverless and thus does not spin up a warehouse, and the fact that they are autoscaling and adjust their warehouse size based on the schedule to keep the task running efficiently.
