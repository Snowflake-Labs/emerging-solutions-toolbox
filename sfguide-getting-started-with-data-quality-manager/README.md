This app is built to provide an interface for Snowflakes native DMF's, as well as a few home brewed Quality Checks from the SIT team!
The manager can create running jobs as well as schedule the Checks directly against a table, and let you review the results of both!

This utilizes Streamlit, Snowpark, Tasks, and DMFs to bring you the experience.

To get started run install.sql and follow its instructions!
