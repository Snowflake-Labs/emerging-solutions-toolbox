Voice of the Customer is a Framework created by Snowflake’s Solution Innovation Team
(SIT). This solution leverages Snowflake’s Cortex Functions, including LLMs and AI SQL,
to handle the summarization, categorization, translation, and sentiment analysis of large
text objects such as call transcripts, chat histories, and feedback data. The process
provides a comprehensive and detailed view of customer interactions, enabling better
insights and decision-making.
