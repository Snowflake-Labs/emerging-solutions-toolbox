## Overview
Snowparser enables Snowflake users to generate native [Snowflake semantic views](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/semantic-views/overview) from existing [Tableau data source files](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/export_connection.htm).  The Snowparser utility is operationalized via a Snowflake Stored Procedure and callable via SQL or Python API.

Snowparser accepts 2 arguments:
- `tableau_data_source_file`: The location of the Tableau data source (.tds) file.
- `view_name`: The desired name of the Snowflake Semantic View

The `tableau_data_source_file` should be a path to a .tds file in Snowflake stage, e.g. `@JSUMMER.PUBLIC.DROPBOX/TPCDS_Model_REVISED.tds`. `view_name` can be a fully qualified name with database and schema or the current database and schema will be used. The utility will replace any semantic view of the same name if a name is re-used.

## Prerequisites
To utilize Snowparser, please take note of the following requirements.

- Your Snowflake account must be enabled for [Semantic Views](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/views-semantic/overview).
- The Tableau data source must not have nor reference any extracts. To remove extracts completely, first switch the data source to a live connection. Then remove references to the extract(s) as described in the 'Remove the extract from the workbook' section in [Tableau documentation](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/extracting_data.htm).
- Semantic View relationships currently support many-to-1 relationships. It is recommended to denote unique keys in Tableau using [Performance Options](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datasource_relationships_perfoptions.htm) in Tableau Desktop.
- A [Tableau Data Source file (.tds)]((https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/export_connection.htm)) must be obtained from Tableau Desktop and uploaded to Snowflake stage.

## Setup
> Note: Deployment requires `ACCOUNTADMIN` to create API integrations.
Snowparser as a Stored Procedure can be registered directly by using Snowflake's git integration. Below are a couple options to do so.

### Snowsight Worksheet
Copy and paste the contents of `register.sql` into a Snowsight SQL Worksheet.
Ensure your context role is appropriate as this will be the owning role of the corresponding objects.
Execute the entire SQL Worksheet.

### VSCode with Snowflake Extension
See [Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code installation documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/vscode-ext) for instructions. Once installed, sign into Snowflake in the extension. Execute all of `register.sql` from VSCode. Ensure your context role is appropriate as this will be the owning role of the corresponding objects.

## Executing
Below is an example of creating a Semantic View directly from the Tableau data source file.

```sql
-- Runs CREATE OR REPLACE DDL for create Semantic View
CALL GENAI_UTILITIES.UTILITIES.SNOWPARSER_CREATE_SEMANTIC(
    tableau_data_source_file => '@JSUMMER.PUBLIC.DROPBOX/TPCDS_Model_REVISED.tds',
    view_name => 'MY_SEMANTIC_VIEW',
    create_views => TRUE -- Default is True so can omit
    );
```

There is an additional helper Stored Procedure to generate the DDL for the semantic view without executing it:
```sql
-- Returns DDL to create Semantic View
CALL GENAI_UTILITIES.UTILITIES.SNOWPARSER_SEMANTIC_DDL(
    tableau_data_source_file => '@JSUMMER.PUBLIC.DROPBOX/TPCDS_Model_REVISED.tds',
    view_name => 'MY_SEMANTIC_VIEW',
    create_views => TRUE -- Default is True so can omit
    );
```
**This will return an OBJECT response with keys `ddl` that contains the DDL for the semantic view and `orphans` which contains elements that were not successfully translated in the semantic view. Each orphaned element will have an explanation.**

If you prefer to not create views for custom SQL Tableau sources, set create_views to False.

There is also a utility function to simply extract the Snowflake tables and columns referenced in a Tableau data source.

```sql
-- Returns JSON of tables and columns
CALL GENAI_UTILITIES.UTILITIES.SNOWPARSER_GET_OBJECTS(
    tableau_data_source_file => '@JSUMMER.PUBLIC.DROPBOX/TPCDS_Model_REVISED.tds',
    create_views => False, -- Default is False so can omit
    defer_conversion => True -- Skips rest of processing beyond object extraction
    );
```

The below example Python implementation shows how Snowparser source can be used outside of a Snowflake Stored Procedure.

```python
from tableau import *

session = Session.builder.configs(...).create()
session.use_database("JSUMMER")
session.use_schema("SAMPLE_DATA")

tds_file = "samples/TPCDS_Model_REVISED.tds"
tableau_model = TableauTDS(tds_file, session)

result = tableau_model.get_view_ddl('MY_SEMANTIC_VIEW')
print(result['ddl'])

tableau_model.create_view('MY_SEMANTIC_VIEW')
```

## Supported Components
We continue to add support for additional capabilities in the Snowflake Semantic View.
Below is a mapping of the supported and explicitly not supported aspects of Tableau features in the Semantic View. Any orphaned elements will be included in the returned object with explanations.
