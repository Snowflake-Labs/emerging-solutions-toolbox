This app was designed to help providers of data give their consumers an easy method of creating iceberg tables over shared data. The application is easy to use, but does require a pre-existing external volume.
Details on how to create an external volume can be found here.
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-volume

This utilizes Streamlit, Snowpark, Tasks, and Iceberg Tables to bring you the experience.

To get started run provider_install.sql and follow its instructions!
