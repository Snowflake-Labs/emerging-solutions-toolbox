# Emerging Solutions Toolbox
#### Brought to you by Snowflake's Solution Innovation Team (SIT)
The Emerging Solutions Toolbox is a collection of solutions created by Snowflake's Solution Innovation Team (SIT).  Each folder represents a separate solution, and solutions can range anywhere between helpful administrative notebooks to fully-fledged frameworks and native applications.  Each solution contains its own licensing agreement, telemetry tagging information, and details on the solution.  Check back frequently, as we'll continually be adding new solutions.
