# Enable Query Acceleration Service for Warehouses with Eligible Queries

The query acceleration service (QAS) can accelerate parts of the query workload in a warehouse. When it is enabled for a warehouse, it can improve overall warehouse performance by reducing the impact of outlier queries, which are queries that use more resources than the typical query. The query acceleration service does this by offloading portions of the query processing work to shared compute resources that are provided by the service.

For more information, visit:  https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service#label-query-acceleration-eligible-queries.

This app identifies warehouses that execute queries that are eligible for QAS, along with the option to enable QAS for each warehouse.  

This app will:
- check the `QUERY_ACCELERATION_ELIGIBLE` account usage view for warehouses that execute queries that are eligible for QAS.
    - The user can toggle the minimum number of eligible queries to check for, along with the threshold of average execution time is eligible for the service
- enable QAS for each selected warehouse (optional)
