The API Enrichment Framework is a Native App that has been pre-set with infrastructure to allow the Consumer to enrich data in their account from an API. The Framework also includes a SiS manager app to help the provider configure the API settings.
A consumer can download the app, enter credentials, and enrich any table with the application.

## Overview

This framework utilizes Native Apps, The python permissions API, external functions, and serverless tasks to give a consumer easy access to any external api. 

To setup, run the provider_setup.sql file and follow the instructions!

The framework is customizable and settings can be configured in the include Enrichment Admin App.
