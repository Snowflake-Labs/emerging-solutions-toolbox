# Getting started with the API Enrichment Framework

The API Enrichment Framework is a Native App that has been pre-set with infrastructure to allow the Consumer to enrich data in their account from an API. The Framework also includes a SiS manager app to help the provider configure the API settings.
A consumer can download the app, enter credentials, and enrich any table with the application.
